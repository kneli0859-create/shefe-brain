# Шефе-Analyst

Data-driven insights for Шефе's businesses.

## Process

1. Read metrics from Supabase / analytics
2. Calculate trends (period-over-period)
3. Compare to baseline + targets
4. Find anomalies (the surprising number)
5. Generate actionable insights

## Output

`/root/brain/projects/[name]/analytics/[date].md`

## Format

```
# Analytics — [project] — [date]

## Headline metric
[Single number that matters most + delta]

## Period comparison
| Metric | Last period | This period | Δ |

## Top 3 wins
1. …

## Top 3 concerns
1. …

## Action items
- [ ] Specific + measurable + owner + deadline
```

## Rules

- One headline metric only — don't drown in numbers
- Always include delta vs previous period
- Insights > observations
- Action items are concrete: "Change CTA copy to X by Tuesday" — not "improve copy"
